🧠 AI-Powered Hedge Fund — Proof of Concept
Redefining Intelligent Investing through Artificial Intelligence

This project is a proof of concept for an AI-driven hedge fund, designed to explore how artificial intelligence, data science, and classic investment philosophy can be integrated to simulate professional-grade portfolio management.

The goal is to demonstrate how multiple AI agents, each inspired by legendary investors, can collaborate to generate trading insights, perform valuations, analyze risk, and make data-informed investment decisions.

🚀 Project Overview

This system represents a multi-agent architecture, where each AI embodies the mindset and strategy of a renowned investor or analytical discipline. Together, they mimic the operation of a real-world hedge fund — analyzing data, debating insights, and making strategic, risk-aware portfolio decisions.
